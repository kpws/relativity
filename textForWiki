Particle trajectories around a clockwise (left) and counter-clockwise (right) rotating black hole. The black hole has mass <math>\ M </math> and <math>\ \alpha=\pm 0.9 </math>. The coordinates in the plots are <math>\ (\cos(\phi)r,\sin(\phi)r) </math>. The particles all start with only horizontal velocity. All particles have conserved energy <math>\ E=1 </math>. This is the energy the particles had infinitely far away from the black hole. }}

Particle trajectories in the plane <math>\theta=\pi/2 </math> around a clockwise (left) and counter-clockwise (right) rotating black hole. The black hole has mass <math>M </math> and <math>\alpha=\pm 0.9 </math>. The coordinates in the plots are <math>(\cos(\phi)r,\sin(\phi)r) </math>. The particles all start with only horizontal velocity at <math>\cos(\phi)r=-10M </math>. All particles have conserved energy <math>E=1</math>. This is the energy per unit mass the particles had infinitely far away from the black hole. Units such that <math>c=1,\ G=1 </math> have been used.}}
